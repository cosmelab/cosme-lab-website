# Lab Schedule Update - Show Most Recent Submissions

## What Changed

**Problem:** Students were tired of resubmitting availability every week when their schedule hadn't changed.

**Solution:** Lab schedule now displays the MOST RECENT submission for each member, not just the current week. Members only need to resubmit when their schedule actually changes!

## Files Modified

1. **lab-schedule-apps-script.gs** - NEW! Updated Google Apps Script backend
2. **lab-schedule.html** - Updated messaging to clarify new behavior
3. **LAB_SCHEDULE_UPDATE.md** - This deployment guide

## How It Works Now

### Before (Old Behavior)
- Script fetched only current week's submissions
- If member didn't submit this week â†’ they don't appear on schedule
- Members had to resubmit every week even if schedule unchanged

### After (New Behavior)
- Script fetches ALL submissions
- Groups by email/name
- Keeps only the MOST RECENT submission for each member
- Shows that on the schedule
- Members only resubmit when schedule changes!

### Example
```
Week 1: Alice submits Mon/Wed 9-12
Week 2: Alice doesn't submit (schedule unchanged)
        â†’ Schedule still shows Alice Mon/Wed 9-12 (from Week 1)
Week 3: Alice updates to Tue/Thu 10-2
        â†’ Schedule now shows Alice Tue/Thu 10-2 (from Week 3)
Week 4: Alice doesn't submit
        â†’ Schedule shows Alice Tue/Thu 10-2 (from Week 3)
```

## Deployment Instructions

### Step 1: Update Google Apps Script

1. **Open your Google Sheet** with availability data
2. **Go to Extensions > Apps Script**
3. **You should see existing code** for the lab schedule endpoint
4. **Select all existing code** and delete it
5. **Copy ALL code** from `lab-schedule-apps-script.gs`
6. **Paste** into the Apps Script editor
7. **Update SHEET_NAME** if your sheet has a different name (line 17):
   ```javascript
   const SHEET_NAME = 'Availability Data'; // Update if different
   ```
8. **Click Save** (disk icon)

### Step 2: Test the Script

1. In Apps Script editor, select function: `testGetData`
2. Click **Run** (play button)
3. Check **Execution log** (bottom panel)
4. You should see:
   ```
   Total members with availability: X
   [JSON data showing each member's most recent submission]
   ```
5. **Verify:** Each member appears only ONCE with their most recent data

### Step 3: Redeploy (If Needed)

**Option A: Use Existing Deployment (Easiest)**
- If you already have a web app deployment, you don't need to redeploy
- Just click **Deploy > Manage deployments**
- Click **Edit** (pencil icon) on your existing deployment
- Click **Deploy** (it will create a new version)
- **Keep the same URL** - no frontend changes needed!

**Option B: New Deployment (If First Time)**
- Click **Deploy > New deployment**
- Select type: **Web app**
- Configure:
  - Description: "Lab Schedule - Most Recent Submissions"
  - Execute as: Me (your account)
  - Who has access: Anyone
- Click **Deploy**
- **Copy the web app URL**
- Update `lab-schedule.js` line 5 with new URL:
  ```javascript
  const APPS_SCRIPT_URL = 'YOUR_NEW_URL_HERE';
  ```

### Step 4: Update Frontend Files

1. **Commit the updated HTML:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/lucianocosme/Projects/ucr-lab-website
   git status
   git add lab-schedule.html
   git commit -m "Update lab schedule to show most recent submissions for each member"
   git push
   ```

2. **Optional: Update JavaScript** (if you created new deployment in Step 3 Option B)
   ```bash
   git add lab-schedule.js
   git commit -m "Update lab schedule API endpoint"
   git push
   ```

### Step 5: Test Live Site

1. **Open your lab schedule page:** https://cosmelab.ucr.edu/lab-schedule.html
2. **Check:**
   - Do all expected members appear?
   - Does the message say "Showing most recent submission"?
   - Click "Refresh Data" - does it work?
3. **Verify logic:**
   - Member who submitted 2 weeks ago should still appear
   - Their availability should be from their last submission

## What Team Members See

### On Lab Schedule Page
- New header message: "Showing most recent submission for each member. Only resubmit if your schedule changes!"
- Submit button now says: "Submit/Update Your Availability"
- Note below button: "Only resubmit if your schedule changes - we'll keep showing your latest submission!"

### Expected Behavior
- **First time:** Submit availability â†’ appears on schedule
- **Week 2-N:** Don't submit â†’ still appears (showing Week 1 data)
- **When changes:** Submit update â†’ schedule updates with new data
- **Future weeks:** Don't submit â†’ keeps showing most recent data

## Communication to Team

### Email Template

**Subject:** Lab Schedule Update - No Need to Resubmit Every Week!

```
Hi Team,

Good news! We've updated the lab schedule system to be less annoying. ðŸ˜Š

What's new:
âœ… You only need to submit your availability when it actually CHANGES
âœ… We'll keep showing your most recent submission on the schedule
âœ… No more weekly resubmissions if your schedule is the same!

How it works:
- Submit your availability once
- It stays on the schedule until you update it
- When your schedule changes, just resubmit

The system automatically shows everyone's most recent submission, so the schedule is always current without the weekly hassle.

Lab Schedule: https://cosmelab.ucr.edu/lab-schedule.html
Update Availability: https://cosmelab.ucr.edu/polls/lab-availability/availability_poll.html

Questions? Let me know!

Dr. Cosme
```

### Slack/Teams Announcement

```
ðŸ“… Lab Schedule Update!

No more weekly resubmissions! ðŸŽ‰

The schedule now shows your most recent availability automatically.
Only resubmit when your schedule actually changes.

Less form fatigue, same functionality! ðŸ’ª
```

## Technical Details

### Data Deduplication Logic

The script groups submissions by email (or name if no email):
```javascript
// Pseudocode
for each row in sheet:
  key = email || name
  if this is first submission for key OR newer than existing:
    keep this submission
  else:
    discard (older data)

return only the most recent submission for each unique member
```

### Performance Notes

- **Before:** Query filtered by date â†’ fast but incomplete
- **After:** Query reads all data â†’ slightly slower but complete
- **Impact:** Negligible for <1000 rows
- **Benefit:** Always shows current availability

### Edge Cases Handled

1. **Member submits multiple times same week**
   - Keeps most recent (latest timestamp)

2. **Member hasn't submitted in months**
   - Still appears with last submission
   - Consider adding "Last updated: X weeks ago" in future

3. **Member changes email**
   - Will appear twice (treated as different members)
   - Solution: Use name as fallback, or manual cleanup

4. **No email column**
   - Falls back to using name for deduplication
   - Works fine if names are unique

## Future Enhancements

### Option 1: Show "Last Updated" Per Member
Add timestamp indicator:
```
Alice (updated 2 weeks ago) - Mon/Wed 9-12
Bob (updated today) - Tue/Thu 10-2
```

### Option 2: Reminder System
Send email if submission > 4 weeks old:
```
"Hey Alice, your availability was last updated 4 weeks ago.
Still the same? No action needed!
Changed? Update here: [link]"
```

### Option 3: Expiry System
Auto-remove submissions older than X weeks:
```
If submission > 8 weeks old:
  Don't show on schedule
  Send reminder email
```

### Option 4: Member Dashboard
Let members see:
- Their current submitted availability
- When they last updated
- Option to quickly update

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: No data showing on schedule

**Check:**
- Apps Script deployment successful?
- "Who has access" set to "Anyone"?
- Web app URL correct in lab-schedule.js?
- Run `testGetData()` function - any errors?

**Fix:**
- Check Apps Script execution logs
- Verify sheet name matches script
- Ensure columns named correctly

### Issue: Duplicate members appearing

**Cause:** Member submitted with different emails or name variations

**Fix:**
- Standardize email/name in submissions
- Or: Update script to normalize names (trim, lowercase)

### Issue: Old data showing for member who updated

**Cause:** Script comparing timestamps incorrectly

**Fix:**
- Check timestamp column format in sheet
- Ensure dates are actual Date objects, not strings
- Test with `testGetData()` function

### Issue: Script timeout

**Cause:** Too much data in sheet (>10,000 rows)

**Fix:**
- Archive old data to separate sheet
- Only keep last 100 rows per member
- Optimize script (read only necessary columns)

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise and you need to go back to old behavior:

1. **Revert Apps Script**
   - Restore previous version from version history
   - Or: Filter results by current week before returning

2. **Revert Frontend**
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push
   ```

3. **Communicate to team**
   - "Temporarily reverted to weekly submissions"
   - "Will fix and redeploy soon"
