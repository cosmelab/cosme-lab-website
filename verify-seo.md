# SEO Verification Checklist

Now that your site is in Google Search Console, follow these steps to maximize the SEO improvements:

## 1. Submit Updated Sitemap (Do Now)

Since we just updated `sitemap.xml` with today's date:

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/search-console?resource_id=https%3A%2F%2Fcosmelab.github.io%2Fcosme-lab-website%2F
2. Click **"Sitemaps"** in the left sidebar
3. If `sitemap.xml` is already there, click **"Remove"** then re-add it
4. Enter: `sitemap.xml`
5. Click **"Submit"**

This tells Google to re-crawl all pages with the new structured data.

## 2. Request Indexing for Updated Pages (Do Now)

Since we added structured data to index.html and research.html:

1. Go to **"URL Inspection"** in the left sidebar
2. Enter: `https://cosmelab.github.io/cosme-lab-website/`
3. Click **"Request Indexing"** (even if it says "URL is on Google")
4. Repeat for: `https://cosmelab.github.io/cosme-lab-website/research.html`

This forces Google to re-index these pages immediately with the new schema markup.

## 3. Verify Structured Data is Working

Use Google's Rich Results Test:

1. Go to: https://search.google.com/test/rich-results
2. Enter your homepage URL: `https://cosmelab.github.io/cosme-lab-website/`
3. Click **"Test URL"**
4. You should see:
   - ✅ Organization
   - ✅ Website
   - ✅ Breadcrumb (on research.html)

If there are errors, let me know and I'll fix them.

## 4. Check Current Indexing Status

In Google Search Console:

1. Go to **"Coverage"** or **"Pages"**
2. Check how many pages are indexed
3. Look for any errors or warnings

Expected: All 12 pages from sitemap should be indexed.

## 5. Monitor Search Performance

In Google Search Console:

1. Go to **"Performance"**
2. Look at:
   - **Total Clicks**: How many people clicked your site
   - **Total Impressions**: How many times your site appeared in search
   - **Queries**: What search terms people used

Note the baseline now, then check again in 2-3 weeks to see improvement.

## 6. Verify UCR Backlink

Check that your lab is properly linked from UCR's website:

1. Search Google for: `site:ucr.edu "cosme lab"`
2. You should see your lab mentioned on UCR's official pages
3. The more UCR pages link to you, the better your SEO
